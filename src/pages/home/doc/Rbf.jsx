          Understanding Revenue-Based Financing
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Traditional loans often come with fixed repayment schedules and
          interest rates. In contrast, Revenue-Based Financing aligns with your
          business's revenue stream. Instead of adhering to rigid monthly
          payments, RBF adapts to your income flow.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Here's how Revenue-Based Financing works: You receive upfront capital
          from <span className="font-semibold">Souqpass</span>, tailored
          to your business needs. In return, you agree to share a percentage of
          your future revenues until a predefined repayment cap is reached. This
          means that when your business thrives, your repayment adjusts
          accordingly.
        </p>
